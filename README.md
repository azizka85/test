Test repository to work with git

This is my first Git project.

1) At first I initialize new git repository
2) At second I add new file: README.md
3) At third I add this file to staging
4) At last I commit all my changes
5) To clone this repository to local machine, use following command:
    git clone https://github.com/azizka85/test.git test-clone
6) To add link to remote server:
    git remote add test https://github.com/azizka85/test.git
7) To push changes to the server:
    git push origin master
