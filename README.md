Test repository to work with git

This is my first Git project.

1) At first I initialize new git repository
2) At second I add new file: README.md
3) At third I add this file to staging
4) At last I commit all my changes
5) To clone this repository to local machine, use following command:
    git clone https://github.com/azizka85/test.git test-clone
6) To add link to remote server:
    git remote add test https://github.com/azizka85/test.git
7) To push changes to the server:
    git push origin master
8) To pull request:
    git pull origin master

To track changes on this repository:

1) git log - log of all changes 
2) git checkout - checkout previous changes
3) git revert - create new commit based on the change which checkout previously
4) git commit --amend - change description and commit changes
5) git status - status of the repository
6) git diff - show differences between repository and working directory
7) git show - show information about commit
8) git rm --cached - remove file from staging
9) git config --global user.email - change email in global config
10) git branch - create new branch from the current branch
11) git checkout - switch branch
12) git branch -d - delete branch
